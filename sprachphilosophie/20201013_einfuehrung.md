    Historicity. Historicity (or historicality:
    Geschichtlichkeit) is a term used in the phenomenological and hermeneutic tradition (from
    Dilthey and Husserl through Heidegger and
    Gadamer) to indicate an essential feature of
    human existence. Persons are not merely in history; their past, including their social past, figures
    in their conception of themselves and their
    future possibilities. Some awareness of the past
    is thus constitutive of the self, prior to being
    formed into a cognitive discipine.

    philosophy of language, the philosophical study
    of natural language and its workings, particularly
    of linguistic meaning and the use of language.

    Contemporary philosophy
    of language centers on the theory of meaning,
    but also includes the theory of reference, the theory of truth, philosophical pragmatics, and the
    philosophy of linguistics.

    In virtue of
    what does a particular set of marks or noises
    express the proposition it does?


understanding a sentence means to grasp the underlying proposition

    It has often been maintained that certain special sentences are true solely in virtue of their
    meanings and/or the meanings of their component expressions, without regard to what the
    nonlinguistic world is like (‘No bachelor is married’; ‘If a thing is blue it is colored’). Such vacuously true sentences are called analytic. 


multiple theories on the nature of meaning 

1. a sentence means what it does because its parts correspond to elements in the real world

2. meaning is a psychological idea

3. meaning is a (societally given) token, which we use

4. meaning is defined as the intended (typical) response of the listener

5. a sentence’s meaning is specified by the set of sentences from which it can correctly be inferred
and the set of those which can be inferred from
it 

6. a sentence’s meaning is
the set of possible experiences that would confirm it or provide evidence for its truth

7.  a sentence’s meaning is the distinctive condition under which it is true,
the situation or state of affairs that, if it obtained,
would make the sentence true

8. the null
hypothesis, or eliminativist view, that “meaning”
is a myth and there is no such thing

theories often summarized under the name 'semantics'

in relation to 'syntax' as the rules under which language is constructed (grammar)
