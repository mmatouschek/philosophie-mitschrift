# Introduction to Academic Writing in Philosophy

## What is academic writing?

* A style of writing aimed at the sharing of scientific knowledge
* Examples include
  * Research papers
  * Academic theses
  * Student essays
  * Textbooks


* Focus on argumentation and clarity of expression
  * Contrast with, say, fiction


* Extensive and methodical reference to other research
  * Contrast with, say, journalism

## Characteristics of academic writing

* **Planned and focused:** answers the question and demonstrates an understanding of the subject

* **Structured:** is coherent, written in a logical order, and brings together related points in material.

* **Evidenced:** demonstrates knowledge of the subject area, supports opinions and arguments with evidence, and is referenced accurately. (not really in Philosophy)

* **Formal in tone and style:** uses appropriate language and tenses, and is clear, concise and balanced.

## Steps in the writing process

* Analyzing the task
* Planning the argument
* Research
* Drafting
* Writing


## Structure

* Introduction -> Main Body -> Conclusion


* Introduction: sets the background and goals of the work and gives the reader the necessary information to interpret the work


* Main body: contains the actual agrument presented in a detailed and logical manner, provides evidence for the main claim
  * Argumentation often happens through various sub-claims and their corresponding sections


* Conclusions: brings together the main point and message of the work
  * May also include answers to expected counter-arguments and highlight avenues for future inquiry


* Try to achieve a logical flow where the argument is easy to follow from section to section and the parts form a coherent whole


* Again, the importance of the context and readership
  * Ideally, present all the information that is needed for the purpose of the paper
  * Ideally, present no more information than is necessary for the purpose of the paper
  * Rules and boundary-conditions help: what is the intended length of the text?
    * Is there a page or word limit? (20P, 10 000W, 50 000C)

## Title and subsections

* Title should faithfully reflect the main point of the text
  * Displinary conventions
  * Concise and informative


* You can use subsections to give your work more structure
  * Typically numbered, the subsection should reflect the general idea of the logical flow of the text
  * E.g., the first section is almost universally titled 'Introduction'


* Balance between different sections
  * Able to do nested subsections like 2.1.3
  * This is done only when necessary
  * Shorter essays may not need subsections at all

## Individual paragraphs

* Write in structured paragraphs
  * Ideally, each paragraph answers one specific question
  * Try to have a decent balance between the length of the paragraphs
  * No continuous two-page paragraphs; give the reader a break!


* Use signalling words to highlight logical transitions and connections
  * Moreover, furthermore, additionally
  * Because, since, as a result
  * In contrast, however, despite of


* You can also list sections to make them more accessible/easier to navigate
  * Firstly, secondly, finally
  * Sometimes you can even number sections: (1), (2), ..

## Situate the work in the scientific literature

* Referring to other academics helps you to
  * Situate your work in a larger context
  * Acknowledge your colleagues and those who came before you
  * Give clues about your style and influences
  * Give further evidence/reasons to your argument


* It is also part of the research phase (one might say: constitutive of the research in the humanities)
  * Motivate your research by building on - and arguing against - other authors


* Can take many kinds of forms
  * Direct quotes
  * Summarization
  * Systematization
  * Contrasting
  * ...

## Language style

* Ideally clear and concise


* The purpose is to bring the logical point across
  * Substantial issue is typically complex enough - no need for complex writing


* Do not use overly long sentences
  * Ideally: one sentence - one idea


* Define your concepts and avoid semantic confusion
  * Do not use multiple words (synonyms) to indicate one and the same thing


* Use formal and gramatically correct language
  * No abbreviations or concatenations of words
  * No slang terms/expressions


* Do not ask questions unless you really mean it
  * Also, very rare to use exclamation marks
  * Be careful with special linguistic devices


* Avoid redundancy, opt for shorter expressions

## Tense and voice

* Choose the correct mode of expression in connection to different functions


* Academic writing uses mostly distance third-person voice
  * Idea is to strice for objectivity
  * Logic instead of emotion


* Mostly present tense mode
  * When presenting your conclusions
  * When citing others people's reseach
  * When detailing the methods used to conduct the research, use past tense
