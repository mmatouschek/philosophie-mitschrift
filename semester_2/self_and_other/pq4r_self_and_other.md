# Self & Other in the Phenomenological Tradition

## Questions

* What does it mean for a self to be 'real'? What difference does it make?
* What exactly is an ontologically independent entity?

* What is the transparency thesis?
* What is higher order representationalism?
* What is the transitivity principle?
* Consciousness vs Self-Consciousness?
* Are subjectivity and the Self contrasting eachother? Why?
* What does normativity in the context of the Self mean?
* How exactly does Husserls theory of temporality work? Temporality and the experiential self?
* What are the problems for the narrative self? Does it explain/include for-me-ness?
* What are the problems for the minimal self?
* Would a materialist be an self-realist, self-antirealist or either?

## The Experiential Self

### Conflicting Perspectives on Self

* Anti-realists denying an entirely different self than what is proposed by realists


* Trying to explain the relationship between empirical and theoretical approaches to Self


* Metzinger: We all have an experience of being a self, but we cannot infer from that to a self being an internal object (anti-realist)
* These sceptic positions deny an ontologically independent self, though zahavi argues that this is not the most common notion defended by realists


* Also science might disagree with anti-realists:
  * Even infants must posess some sort of self-cognition, since they are able to perceive when objects are within their reach
  * Schizophrenia is believed to change the the relationship to one's thoughts, actions and sensations
  * Alzheimers effects of degenerative brain functions often is described as an increasing loss of the self
  * Most scientists might have a difficulty accepting Metzinger's notion that 'nobody ever was or had a self'


* Zahavi calls for an interdisciplinary effort to research the Self, with philosophy conceptualizing issues and providing theses and science finding empirical evidence.


* Critique of Experimentalists: lack of clarity of the tested concept leads to a lack of clarity in the result


### Consciousness, Self-Concsiousness, and Selfhood

* The 'socially constructed' self
  * self-consciousness is a question of becoming 'an object to one's self in virtue of one's social relations to other individuals
  * 'Subjectivity is a cultural and linguistic construction'
  * Implication: the self is not a given, therefore you might fail at it (without a social environment, etc.)

* The minimal self | experiential self
  * Pre-reflective consciousness - primitive mode of 'experience'
  * Reflective consciousness - consciousness directs its intentional aim at itself, presupposes pre-reflective consciousness
  * Sartre: an experience does not just exist, it is implicitly self given (self-conscious) - (pre-reflective) self-consciousness is an intrinsic feature of experience
  * Husserl: self can be equated to
    * First personal character of Consciousness
    * a primitive form of self-consciousness
    * a certain basic form of selfhood (p.12)

  * Zahavi: the term 'self-consciousness', especially used colloquially, is quite ambiguous
    * His definition: self-consciousness comes in many different forms and degrees, highest form might be reflecting on personal character one ones life, most primitive form is a question of the ongoing first.personal manifestation of one's own experiential life
    * A state is phenomenally conscious if its presence or absence makes a distinctive difference how it is subjectively
    * Pre-reflective: experience is given, not as an object, but precisely as a sublectively lived through


  * Galen Strawson: there are necessary and sufficient properties that constitute a self - phenomenologists would agree
  * Husserl: reflection on a single experience will reveal the nature of the pure ego
  * Objects and intentionality of experience can vary, but the first-personal character, the what-it-is-like-for-me-ness stays constant
  * Zahavi: to deny subjectivity amounts to the claim that my own mind is either not given to me at all (mind-, selfblind) or as present to me as the minds of others.

### Transparency and Anonymity

* Dreyfus: subjectivity is a lingering ghost of the mental, total absorbtion leads to a ceasing of a subject altogether, we are so world engaged that our life is oblivious of itself - only when this immersion is interrupted, something like self-consciousness emerges


* Anonymity objection: there is no for-me-ness n the pre-reflective level, nor an I or self. the pre-reflective level is characterized by anonymity, and there is always the capacity for self-consciousness with the possibility of actualizing it
  * This implies that it restricts conscious mental states to creatures capable of reflection (denies it for infants and most non-human animals)
  * Only the realization that experience takes place from a first-person perspective, the experience is given as subjective, thereby in a first-person mode of givenness. Subjectivity of experience is therefore not primitive, as it presupposes the distinction between one's own experience and the experience of others
  * This dispute is mostly terminological - as the self-reference of the minimal self does not entail self-knowledge or awareness and does not require any linguistic capabilities
  * More radical claim: experience is not phenomenal, the phenomenal lies in the objects perceived and even if we introspect, we are not conscious or aware of the experience itself - there is no subjective content to be found introspectively
  * Zahavi agrees on the level of perception (seeing, tasting, etc. - phenomenal externalism), though perception hardly exhausts the dimension of phenomenality - for example can an object be perceived in many different ways
  * Husserl: we have to differentiate between 'im Wie seiner Bestimmtheiten' and 'im Wie seiner Gegebenheitsweisen' - seeing a blue square is different from remembering or imagining a blue square
  * We need to be able to differ between the case where the subject is conscious of what she perceives, and the case where she is conscious of the fact that she perceives.


* Self consciousness for Zahavi only means that consciousness has access to or is acquainted with itself

* Metzinger: Mineness is not a necessary component of experience (schizophrenic thought-insertion, in which patients have no sense of agency or ownership)
  * Zahavi: Even if the patient reports a thought as feeling intrusive, it is still theirs to experience it, within their own stream of consciousness (of which they do claim ownership)

### Subjectivity or Selfhood

**The illusory self**

* Albahari: The self should be understood as a unified, happiness-seeking, unbrokenly persisting, ontologically distinct conscious subject who is the owner of experiences
* Albahari ascribes these features to consciousness, but not to a self
* There is a close link between having a sense of personal ownership and having a sense of self - though the sense of self is real, this doesnt entail that the sense is real
* Albahari: An illusion involves a conflict between appearance and reality: x is illusory if x does not have any appearance-independent reality

* Zahavi: Her only issue is that the self does not possess the property of ontological independence

* Zahavi argues, that Albaharis theory is more robust than the theory defended by many self-realists, though she would argue that Zahavis theory is so deflationary, that his position ends up being similar to a no-self theory. And Zahavi (sort of) agrees

**Normativity and narrativity**

* Korsgaard: Both humans and non-human possess some sort of self-consciousness, but human beings are are capabale of recognising desires or fears, as well as our inclination to act upon those desires or fears - we can be conscious of the reasons behind our actions. This leads to the liberation of instincts, they still operate within us, but dont determine our actions entirely
